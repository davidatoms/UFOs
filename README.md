# UFOs
The purpose of this project is to create a table and organize data about UFO sightings within that table. The data will be stored as a JavaScript array or list, and you should have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria. 

## What I Achieved/Learned:
- How to explain the strengths and weaknesses of JavaScript's "standard" and JavaScript version ES6+.
- How to describe JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases.
- How to build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.
- How to convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions.
- How to build and deploy 'forEach' (JavaScript 'for' loop.
- How to create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML.
