# UFOs
The purpose of this project is to create a table and organize data about UFO sightings within that table. The data will be stored as a JavaScript array or list, and you should have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria. 

## What I Achieved/Learned:
- How to explain the strengths and weaknesses of JavaScript's "standard" and JavaScript version ES6+.
- How to describe JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases.
- How to build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.
- How to convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions.
- How to build and deploy 'forEach' (JavaScript 'for' loop.
- How to create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML.

## Results
The project is meant to filter data with a button. It simplifies the process for the users of the sit to navigate it and find what they are looking for when they browse. Furthermore, the design of the website looks like a pro analytics service similar to what I have seen on Coinbase Pro or ETRADE Pro.

## Summary
Last night (May 5th, 2021), I saw a bunch of lights in a line across the sky. I quickly googled it to figure out what they were. SpaceX has satellites in orbit around the earth. I believe any kind of sightings like this can be notated and available for research. The UFOs project is meant to provide internet users a database of potential unidentified, or identified, flying objects.
